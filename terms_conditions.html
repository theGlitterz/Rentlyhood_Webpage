          <p>Thank you for joining the RentlyHood community. Your use of our

            with, these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms of

          <p>The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to you, the user of the
            Service. The terms "RENTLYHOOD," "we," "us," and "our" refer to
            Rentlyhood. This Agreement exists solely between you and RENTLYHOOD.
            We may periodically make changes to this Agreement. It is your
            responsibility to review the most recent version of these Terms of
            Service frequently and remain informed of any changes to it. You

          <br>
          <h3 id="Nature_of_the_Service">Nature of the Service </h3>
          <p>The Service allows users to rent from, and lend goods ("Loaned
            Items") to other users. Use of the Service may require a compatible
            mobile device/laptop and/or access to a data network. Third party
            data use fees may apply.</p>

          <br>
          <h3 id="How_renting_works">How renting works</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Users register for the Service and find an item for rent listed
              by an Owner/lender.</li>
            <li>The Rentee may then request to rent the item from the
              Owner/Lender for a specified time period, mentioned pick-up
              location and calculated price shown on the app.</li>
            <li>Based upon the requested date, Lender may approve or reject
              rentee’s request. Once approved, rentee and lender may use in-app
              chat to further align/agree on any other details.</li>
            <li>Rentee would then proceed ahead with the payment on the app.</li>
            <li>On rental start date, rentee should pick-up items from Lender
              from the mentioned pick-up location. Unless otherwise agreed by
              Owner/lender and Rentee in writing via in-app chat, all rented
              items are to be picked up and returned during the rental period
              specified on the website/app.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All rented items must be returned at or before the time scheduled.
            Failure to return a rented item in a timely manner shall be a
            violation of these Terms of Service and shall result in the
            imposition of a late fee. Repeated or prolonged failure to return a
            rented item or items in a timely manner, in addition to grounds for
            the imposition of late fees, shall be a violation of these Terms of
            Service, grounds for termination of the user’s account, and may be
            reported to law enforcement as possible theft.</p>

          <br>
          <h3 id="Late_fee_Charges">Late fee Charges</h3>
          <p>Rentals returned late as per the schedule on the site, or after the
            previously agreed upon time to return the item, are subject to a
            late fee as follows <b>(unless agreed with lender in written via
              in-app chat)</b>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Items returned late up to 2 hours* but same day as due: 20% of
              the daily rental charge</li>
            <li>Items returned late by more than 2 hours* but same day as due:
              100% of the daily rental charge</li>
            <li>Items returned late and not on the same day as due: 110% of the
              daily rental charge per day</li>
          </ul>
          <p>*Hours calculations follow the 24 hour principle from the time of
            pick-up. For example, If Rentee has picked-up an item on 21st March
            10:00 AM for 2 days then the item has to returned by 23rd March
            10:00 AM</p>
          <ul>

          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3 id="Damage_Charges">Damage Charges</h3>
          <p>As a Rentee ("person who has taken item on rent from Lender") of a
            rented Item, you are responsible for returning the rented Item in
            the condition it was in when you obtained it (less normal wear and
            tear). You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are
            also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom
            you permit to use or otherwise access the Loaned Item.</p>
          <p>(a)<b> For Rentee:</b> As a Rentee you are responsible for any
            damage caused to the loaned item arising out of accidental, misuse
            or abuse of the equipment or intentional damage.</p>
          <p>(b)<b> Claims against Borrower by Owner:</b> If the owner ("Owner")
            of a Loaned/rented Item claims and provides evidence that you as a
            Borrower have damaged a Loaned/rented Item (a "Damage Claim"), the
            Owner may assert a Damage Claim with Rentlyhood. If an Owner makes a
            Damage Claim to Rentlyhood, the Borrower/rentee will be provided a
            reasonable opportunity to respond. Rentlyhood will decide as to
            whether the damage alleged in the Damage Claim was caused by
            Borrower/rentee. Rentlyhood’s determination shall be final and
            binding as between Owner/lender and Borrower/Rentee with respect to
            any Damage Claim. Such determination relates to damages to the
            Borrowed/rented Item only, and not to any other alleged damages,
            including any damages to property, or third parties.</p>
          <p>If Rentlyhood determines a Borrower/rentee is responsible for the
            Damage Claim, Borrower/rentee agrees to pay such amounts to Lender
            via Rentlyhood only. In the event Borrower/rentee fails to pay on a
            Damage Claim within ten (10) days of Rentlyhood decision on a Damage
            Claim, Rentlyhood will seek reimbursement from Borrower/Rentee to
            the extent Rentlyhood or its insurer (if any) pays out on a Damage
            Claim. <b>RentlyHood is not an insurance company, broker, or agent.</b>
            Rentlyhood is not an insurance provider, broker, or agent.
            Rentlyhood is not licensed in any state or country to be an
            insurance provider, broker, or agent.</p>

          <br>

            use of any Equipment obtained through Rentlyhood’s platform,
            website, or mobile application. Borrower/Rentee acknowledges
            Equipment available on Rentlyhood’s platform may be inherently
            dangerous, even if used properly.</p>
          <p>Borrower/Rentee agrees use of Equipment involves many obvious and
            not-so-obvious risks, dangers, and hazards, which may result in
            property damage, injury or death, and such risks cannot always be
            predicted or avoided.</p>

            maintained, and does not include any known material defects.
            Rentlyhood does not perform any independent testing or physical

          <h3 id="Rentlyhood_Guarantee">Rentlyhood Guarantee</h3>
          <p>Rentlyhood is essentially a sharing platform where mutual trust
            between neighbors is important. We therefore always advise neighbors
            to make good agreements with each other via our in-app chat. If
            something goes wrong despite all the good intentions, we have the
            Rentlyhood guarantee. This guarantee is there to ensure that renting
            out and lending out items can be done safely and without any
            worries. For the owner of the product, there is always a Rentlyhood
            guarantee when renting out and lending items. The Rentlyhood
            guarantee applies to borrowers if there is no intent or negligence.
            The warranty protects against damage, loss and theft, up to a
            maximum amount of €1,000.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>you have an existing Rentlyhood account (so your account has not
              been deleted);</li>
            <li>you are 18 years or older;</li>
            <li>you made the appointment via the Rentlyhood chat and processed
              the payment via Rentlyhood</li>
            <li>the products that need to be repaired or replaced are described
              in your advertisement or the agreement with your neighbour. So
              make sure you name all the items when you make the appointment via
              the Rentlyhood chat. For example: if you lend a game console with
              two controllers to your neighbor, but your advertisement says it
              is one, name that extra controller in the chat;</li>
            <li>check the items together when returning them and report damage
              no later than 48 hours after the end of the rental or loan. Take
              photos of the damage and a description and email it to
              “contact@rentlyhood.com”; and</li>
            <li>Is your product insured or do you still have a warranty with the
              store? Then you should first appeal to them for the same.</li>

            <li>cosmetic damage: we can only pay out the guarantee in case of
              such damage that it impedes the function of the object;</li>
            <li>cleaning costs: it is not the intention to return items dirty,
              but Rentlyhood has no responsibility to pay for any cleaning costs
              or for a replacement product;</li>
            <li>damage or theft outside the rental or loan period; and</li>
            <li>if the rental has not been paid for in advance via the
              Rentlyhood payment function.</li>
            <li>In the event of damage caused by intent or negligence, theft by
              the hirer/borrower, and/or other fraud or acting in bad faith,
              Rentlyhood reserves the right to recover the damage and/or
              replacement from the hirer/borrower.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will review the damage and let you know whether or not it
            qualifies for the Rentlyhood warranty. In some cases we may ask you
            for additional information. Does your application for guarantee not
            comply with the rules or is there a suspicion of fraud? Then
            Rentlyhood reserves the right not to apply the warranty or only
            partially. If your report is in good faith and complies with the
            rules, you can in most cases assume that the guarantee will be
            granted.</p>
          <p>If you qualify for the Rentlyhood guarantee, we will refund you an
            amount. Transfer the outstanding claim you have against your
            neighbor to us so that we can follow up on it.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Ask and explain how to use the product. In most cases damage is

              of a product</li>
            <li>Treat someone else's belongings as you would your own</li>
            <li>Make clear agreements about what you expect from each other via
              Rentlyhood in-app chat</li>
            <li>Before and after the rental, take good quality pictures of the
              item so that you have proof of the items rented, in case of any
              dispute</li>
            <li>Sharing is based on mutual reasonableness , trust and respect</li>
