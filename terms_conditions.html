            <h1>Terms and Conditions for Rentlyhood</h1>

            <p>Thank you for joining the RentlyHood community. Your use of our app/ website - https://rentlyhood .com website (the "Service") is governed by these Terms of Service (the "Agreement"). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by, and use the Service in compliance with, these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms of service, do not use the service.</p>
            <p>The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to you, the user of the Service. The terms "RENTLYHOOD," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Rentlyhood. This Agreement exists solely between you and RENTLYHOOD. We may periodically make changes to this Agreement. It is your responsibility to review the most recent version of these Terms of Service frequently and remain informed of any changes to it. You agree that your continued use of the service after such changes have been published to the service shall constitute your acceptance of such revised terms of service.</p>

            <h3>Nature of the Service </h3>
            <p>The Service allows users to rent from, and lend goods ("Loaned Items") to other users. Use of the Service may require a compatible mobile device/laptop and/or access to a data network. Third party data use fees may apply.</p>

            <h3>How renting works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Users register for the Service and find an item for rent listed by an Owner/lender.</li>
                <li>The Rentee may then request to rent the item from the Owner/Lender for a specified time period, mentioned pick-up location and calculated price shown on the app.</li>
                <li>Based upon the requested date, Lender may approve or reject rentee’s request. Once approved, rentee and lender may use in-app chat to further align/agree on any other details.</li>
                <li>Rentee would then proceed ahead with the payment on the app.</li>
                <li>On rental start date, rentee should pick-up items from Lender from the mentioned pick-up location. Unless otherwise agreed by Owner/lender and Rentee in writing via in-app chat, all rented items are to be picked up and returned during the rental period specified on the website/app.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All rented items must be returned at or before the time scheduled. Failure to return a rented item in a timely manner shall be a violation of these Terms of Service and shall result in the imposition of a late fee.  Repeated or prolonged failure to return a rented item or items in a timely manner, in addition to grounds for the imposition of late fees, shall be a violation of these Terms of Service, grounds for termination of the user’s account, and may be reported to law enforcement as possible theft.</p>

            <h3>Late fee Charges</h3>
            <p>Rentals returned late as per the schedule on the site, or after the previously agreed upon time to return the item, are subject to a late fee as follows <b>(unless agreed with lender in written via in-app chat)</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Items returned late up to 2 hours* but same day as due: 20% of the daily rental charge</li>
                <li>Items returned late by more than 2 hours* but same day as due: 100% of the daily rental charge</li>
                <li>Items returned late and not on the same day as due: 110% of the daily rental charge per day</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*Hours calculations follow the 24 hour principle from the time of pick-up. For example, If Rentee has picked-up an item on 21st March 10:00 AM for 2 days then the item has to returned by 23rd March 10:00 AM</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For latest and updated terms, visit ‘Terms and Conditions’ on https://www.rentlyhood.com</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Damage Charges</h3>
            <p>As a Rentee ("person who has taken item on rent from Lender") of a rented Item, you are responsible for returning the rented Item in the condition it was in when you obtained it (less normal wear and tear). You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you permit to use or otherwise access the Loaned Item.</p>
            <p>(a)<b> For Rentee:</b> As a Rentee you are responsible for any damage caused to the loaned item arising out of accidental, misuse or abuse of the equipment or intentional damage.</p>
            <p>(b)<b> Claims against Borrower by Owner:</b> If the owner ("Owner") of a Loaned/rented Item claims and provides evidence that you as a Borrower have damaged a Loaned/rented Item (a "Damage Claim"), the Owner may assert a Damage Claim with Rentlyhood. If an Owner makes a Damage Claim to Rentlyhood, the Borrower/rentee will be provided a reasonable opportunity to respond. Rentlyhood will decide as to whether the damage alleged in the Damage Claim was caused by Borrower/rentee. Rentlyhood’s determination shall be final and binding as between Owner/lender and Borrower/Rentee with respect to any Damage Claim. Such determination relates to damages to the Borrowed/rented Item only, and not to any other alleged damages, including any damages to property, or third parties.</p>
            <p>If Rentlyhood determines a Borrower/rentee is responsible for the Damage Claim, Borrower/rentee agrees to pay such amounts to Lender via Rentlyhood only. In the event Borrower/rentee fails to pay on a Damage Claim within ten (10) days of Rentlyhood decision on a Damage Claim, Rentlyhood will seek reimbursement from Borrower/Rentee to the extent Rentlyhood or its insurer (if any) pays out on a Damage Claim. <b>RentlyHood is not an insurance company, broker, or agent.</b> Rentlyhood is not an insurance provider, broker, or agent. Rentlyhood is not licensed in any state or country to be an insurance provider, broker, or agent.</p>

            <h3>Rentlyhood Guarantee</h3>
            <p>Rentlyhood is essentially a sharing platform where mutual trust between neighbors is important. We therefore always advise neighbors to make good agreements with each other via our in-app chat. If something goes wrong despite all the good intentions, we have the Rentlyhood guarantee. This guarantee is there to ensure that renting out and lending out items can be done safely and without any worries. For the owner of the product, there is always a Rentlyhood guarantee when renting out and lending items. The Rentlyhood guarantee applies to borrowers if there is no intent or negligence. The warranty protects against damage, loss and theft, up to a maximum amount of €2,000.</p>
            <h5>To qualify for the Rentlyhood Guarantee, you must meet these requirements:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>you have an existing Rentlyhood account (so your account has not been deleted);</li>
                <li>you are 18 years or older;</li>
                <li>you made the appointment via the Rentlyhood chat and processed the payment via Rentlyhood</li>
                <li>the products that need to be repaired or replaced are described in your advertisement or the agreement with your neighbour. So make sure you name all the items when you make the appointment via the Rentlyhood chat. For example: if you lend a game console with two controllers to your neighbor, but your advertisement says it is one, name that extra controller in the chat;</li>
                <li>check the items together when returning them and report damage no later than 48 hours after the end of the rental or loan. Take photos of the damage and a description and email it to “contact@rentlyhood.com”; and</li>
                <li>Is your product insured or do you still have a warranty with the store? Then you should first appeal to them for the same.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The following items are not eligible for the Rentlyhood guarantee:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>All damage, theft or other costs with regard to items that have not been lent or rented through Rentlyhood;</li>
                <li>everything that does not fall under the heading of consumer products, so no food, leftover paint, plants, etc;</li>
                <li>vans, passenger cars, motorcycles and other motorized means of transport;</li>
                <li>property;</li>
                <li>clothing cleaning costs;</li>
                <li>foodstuffs; and</li>
                <li>drugs, weapons and other illegal products.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The following situations are excluded from the Rentlyhood guarantee</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>lost income: (rental) income that you miss out on due to damage or loss of your product;</li>
                <li>cosmetic damage: we can only pay out the guarantee in case of such damage that it impedes the function of the object;</li>
                <li>cleaning costs: it is not the intention to return items dirty, but Rentlyhood has no responsibility to pay for any cleaning costs or for a replacement product;</li>
                <li>damage or theft outside the rental or loan period; and</li>
                <li>if the rental has not been paid for in advance via the Rentlyhood payment function.</li>
                <li>In the event of damage caused by intent or negligence, theft by the hirer/borrower, and/or other fraud or acting in bad faith, Rentlyhood reserves the right to recover the damage and/or replacement from the hirer/borrower.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will review the damage and let you know whether or not it qualifies for the Rentlyhood warranty. In some cases we may ask you for additional information. Does your application for guarantee not comply with the rules or is there a suspicion of fraud? Then Rentlyhood reserves the right not to apply the warranty or only partially. If your report is in good faith and complies with the rules, you can in most cases assume that the guarantee will be granted.</p>
            <p>If you qualify for the Rentlyhood guarantee, we will refund you an amount. Transfer the outstanding claim you have against your neighbor to us so that we can follow up on it.</p>

            <h5>To be able to pay out the warranty, we need two more things from you:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>a copy of the receipt and bank statement that shows us that you have purchased a replacement product or the cost of the repair;</li>
                <li>you verify your personal details by providing us with a copy of your passport/ID/driving license.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the above has been done, we will transfer it to you as soon as possible.</p>

            <h5>Tips to prevent accidents:</h5>
            <p>Prevention is better than cure. Therefore, here are some tips that can help prevent damage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask and explain how to use the product. In most cases damage is not caused intentionally, but due to unintentionally incorrect use of a product</li>
                <li>Treat someone else's belongings as you would your own</li>
                <li>Make clear agreements about what you expect from each other via Rentlyhood in-app chat</li>
                <li>Before and after the rental, take good quality pictures of the item so that you have proof of the items rented, in case of any dispute</li>
                <li>Sharing is based on mutual reasonableness , trust and respect</li>
            </ul>
